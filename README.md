## Project Overview ðŸŽ‰

A store for buying ready-made cakes accessories and also designing custom cakes to order. The user can choose the shape, size, sponge flavor, cream flavor, and decorations that will be on the ordered cake. They also select the date and delivery address for the products. If the user has special requirements, they can contact the store through a contact form. The site is written in Angular and uses Firebase to store users and order data.

#### Buying products

The user just adds items from the store to the cart or favorites. Then he can place an order indicating a specific day and delivery address.

#### Creating a cake

The user can also buy a cake of his own design in the store - a special designer allows to choose the type, size, color and flavors of the cake. The customer also indicates what decorations should be on his cake.

#### Logging and data storage

The site uses Firebase to store users and order data. The logged in user has access to his previous orders. 
The cart and favorites of users are stored in localstorage so that they do not lose access to added products after refreshing or leaving the page
